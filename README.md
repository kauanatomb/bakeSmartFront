# BakeSmart

## Description

BakeSmart is an application designed to solve the challenges faced by small culinary entrepreneurs and cooking enthusiasts in managing recipe production costs. This project aims to assist in setting selling prices and maximizing profits.

## Problem

Many small producers of sweets and savories struggle to calculate the production costs of their recipes, which directly affects selling prices and profits. Manual methods, Excel, or complex and expensive software are the most common options currently available, making the process laborious and inaccessible.

## Solution

BakeSmart addresses this issue by providing users with a platform to input ingredients, costs, categories, and units of measurement. With this data, the application automatically calculates the total cost of a recipe, simplifying the process and providing more efficient management.

## Features

- Ingredient registration with unit costs and units of measurement.
- Recipe creation with ingredients, quantities, and measures.
- Calculation of production costs per recipe.

## Future Features

- Price suggestion based on costs and desired profit margin.
- Inventory management.
- Recipe scheduling according to a calendar.
- Visual reports to display costs and profits for each recipe.

## Implementation
 
- **Project Status**: The project is under constant maintenance.
